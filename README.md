# FoDS-Assignment2
Second Assignment done for the partial completion of the course Foundations of Data Science (CS F320)


BITS F320 – Foundations of Data Science
II Semester 2018-19
Assignment #2
Due Date:25th April (Thursday), 2019
Weightage – 10%
Time-series Classification - Occupancy Detection
Apply different techniques (at least 2) to classify time-series data to predict occupancy in an office
room. The variables involved are:
1. date time year-month-day hour:minute:second
2. Temperature, in Celsius
3. Relative Humidity, %
4. Light, in Lux
5. CO2, in ppm
6. Humidity Ratio, Derived quantity from temperature and relative humidity, in kgwatervapor/
kg-air
7. Occupancy, 0 or 1, 0 for not occupied, 1 for occupied status
Dataset: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Occupancy+Detection+#
Implement all your models in R.
Assignment Groups: Form a team of up to 3 students (same groups as for Assignment #1)
You will be provided with a presentation template in which you will need to fill the details.
